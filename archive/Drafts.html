    <h1 id = "Angel"> Angel Wings </h1>
    <p> I nicknamed this piece The Ugly Duckling because it took me such a long time to get the facial proportions just right! In my efforts to salvage the illustration, I ended up trying out a thicker oblique pen, which gave the character outline a cartoony effect that I really like. </p>
    <p> This piece was initially illustrated in Procreate, then animated using After Effects. The 3D gizmo was used to transform the wings' perspective to make them appear as though they're turning as they flap, while the puppet tool was used to animate the hair and clothes moving in the wind. The spinning halo and its associated sparkles were created in After Effects through a mixture of shape tools, gaussian blurs, and particle effects.  </p>

    <p> A water genasi researcher analyzes a crystal shard deposit and makes a slimy new friend! I was compelled to make this piece after scrolling through the r/characterdrawing subreddit, which mainly consists of people posting and comissioning art to get inspiration for their tabletop roleplay campaigns. I wanted to make a piece that would encourage the viewer to make up their own stories about the character and their surroundings. I dedicated a lot of time towards making the cavern look like it was awash with the reflective light of the crystals. </p>

  <h1 id = "Buggs"> Marshfield Drive-In Tiktok - Space Jam: 2 </h1>
  <p> This is one of the Tiktok animations I made to promote upcoming films at the Marshfield Drive-In, where I worked as a manager over the summer. Movies weren't decided on until the week they were shown, so they were made with a short turn-around time of 2 to 3 days! </p>
  <p> For Space Jam, I wanted to create something fun and energetic with a specific link to basketball so people wouldn't be confused about what film was being shown. The end product weirdly feels reminiscent to me of animations that play in certain bowling alleys.
  <p> I created the vector art in Illustrator, seperated the layers, and animated them in After Effects. It was a lot of fun moving different aspects of Buggs' face and ears to make him more expressive. Certain elements, such as the circular transition outlines, were made with shape tools in After Effects.

    <h1 id = "Ghost"> A Boy and His Feline Familiar </h1>
    <p> I really enjoy depicting fantastical elements in everyday settings. I had a clear idea in mind of a British schoolboy interacting with some kind of otherworldly being. It was a balancing act to level the shading of the setting sun along with the green phantom glow, but I think it works - especially in the places where the ghost is passing through him. </p>

    <p> Fire blast! This was a fun piece because I didn't really know how it was going to end when I started it - I just knew I wanted to draw a goblin casting a magic spell. It's not shown on the time-lapse, but a lot of time was spent meticulously pushing and pulling that block of orange and yellow around to turn it into flames using liquify and bloom effects.

    <h1 id = "Jaws"> Marshfield Drive-In Tiktok - Jaws </h1>
    <p> This is another animation I made to promote upcoming films at the Marshfield Drive-In. It was made in 2 days! </p>
    <p> The video is loosely based around the original movie poster with some artistic license taken here and there to keep it family friendly. I kept the same art style I used for the Space Jam: 2 promotion to both keep it consistient and so I could get away with showcasing the violence and gore in the film without traumitizing anyone! <p>
    <p> I repeated the same process I had for the Space Jam Tiktok by making most of the assets in Illustrator and keyframing the movement and rotation in After Effects. The swimmer's body parts were all isolated to allow for individual manipulation. The ocean waves are a long rectangle with a sine wave top that's slowly being moved horizontally to make it appear like the waves are cresting and falling. </p>

    <h1 id = "Sword"> Fighter in the Forest </h1>
    <p> I had a lot of fun with this piece. It took a bit to really nail down the pose to make sure everything was proportionate. I used this illustration as a way to experiment with various texture brushes so that each piece of her armor felt distinct and you could get a sense of the materials. The chainmail took the longest because I drew each scale out by hand, then individually added shading and lighting to them. I also was quite happy with how the lighting on her two swords turned out - they really feel like the metal is shimmering through the darkness.  </p>

  <div class = "sketchcolumn2">
    <h1 id = "COVID"> COVID-19 Vaccination Preregistration App </h1>
    <p> I created this mockup for a vaccine preregistration app for my Design Process Context Systems class in during the 2021 spring semester, right as the vaccine rollout began in earnest. A lot of the first state initiatives to sign people up to get vaccinated were on their government websites, which were servicable but not very visually compelling. I thought creating a mobile app that was concise, pleasing to the eye, and easy to promote through QR codes might inspire more people to push through the long list of questions and ultimately preregister. Funnily enough, as I was working on this project in April I was cleared to get my first Pfizer shot! </p>
    <p> Looking back, there's a lot of elements on the first draft that aren't working well. The icons don't feel cohesive because the line weights are off. Even though my tech-savvy Gen Z eyes may feel like the interface is big enough, it still could be scaled up to make it more broadly accessible - particularly for older audiences. Overall, it's lacking in user feedback features and needed to be organized better, so I gave it a face lift. I think the new colors pop a lot more - I swapped out the red for turquoise to give the UI a more comforting feeling. I added some additional thickness to whichever option is currently selected to make it even more obvious to the user. The last significant change I made was to add a progress bar at the bottom to persuade the user to stick it out through the end of the long form. </p>

    <h1 id = "Turtle"> Turtle Time </h1>
    <p> This illustration went in a couple different directions. I drew a quick sketch of a girl holding a rabbit, but that eventually turned into a girl holding a sea dragon before eventually settling on turtles. It's very cool to see how your initial vision for a piece can widely diverge as you work on it. One of my favorite aspects of this is the detailing on her clothes and hair to make it look like they're floating in the water. I think it really helps ground this drawing - without it, it feels like she could be sitting anywhere. It helps embeds her into this underwater scene. </p>
